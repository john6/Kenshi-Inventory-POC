# Kenshi-Inventory-POC
This project is an attempt to independently adapt the knapsack algorithm to dynamically sort non-rotatable rectangles such that they would fit within another rectangular container. I was inspired to create this by the pc game "Kenshi". The goal was to create an algorithm whereby an inventory would autosort itself to create space for any new item a user attempted to place with that inventory. After attempting to deduce a method independently, I checked the available pre-existing methods, and found that my solution resembles the “guillotine heuristic”.  It currently has a run time of O(⋅Height⋅Width⋅Items2).

In any example of simple or medium complexity, its will find the optimal solution. Using examples taken from the game "Kenshi" I created as complex examples as I possibly could, and was somewhat successful. My algorithm was able to find the correct solution in a few of these examples, but was unable to find the correct solution in others.

Since there is a finite number of items and backpack dimensions in "Kenshi", it would be possible to "hard code" a solution for this, where an optimal solution doesn't currently exist in real world applications (Not counting solutions that exhaustively check every possibility, do to unmanageable runtime). If I choose to create a game mod with this functionality, I may be able to take some short cuts due to known edge cases, but it would take quite a bit of time.
