# Kenshi-Inventory-POC
This project is an attempt to independently adapt the knapsack algorithm to dynamically sort non-rotatable rectangles such that they would fit within another rectangular container.   I was inspired to create this by the pc game "Kenshi". The goal was to create an algorithm whereby an inventory would autosort itself to create space for any new item a user attempted to place with that inventory. After attempting to deduce a method independently, I checked the available pre-existing methods, and found that my solution resembles the “guillotine heuristic”.  It currently has a run time of O(⋅Height⋅Width⋅Items2).
